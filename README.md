# rrule

## Description

rrule is a minimalist library for expanding RRULEs, with a goal of being fully compliant with [iCalendar spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2445).

## Examples

To install this gem, add it to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rrule'
```

Create an rrule with an RRULE string:

```ruby
rrule = RRule::Rule.new('FREQ=DAILY;COUNT=3')
rrule = RRule.parse('FREQ=DAILY;COUNT=3') # alternate syntax
```

### Generating recurrence instances

Either generate all instances of a recurrence, or generate instances in a range:

```ruby
rrule.all
=> [2016-06-23 16:45:32 -0700, 2016-06-24 16:45:32 -0700, 2016-06-25 16:45:32 -0700]
rrule.between(Time.new(2016, 6, 23), Time.new(2016, 6, 24))
=> [2016-06-23 16:45:32 -0700]
```

You can limit the number of instances that are returned with the `limit` option:

```ruby
rrule = RRule::Rule.new('FREQ=DAILY;COUNT=3')
rrule.all(limit: 2)
=> [2016-06-23 16:45:32 -0700, 2016-06-24 16:45:32 -0700]
```

By default the DTSTART of the recurrence is the current time, but this can be overriden with the `dtstart` option:

```ruby
rrule = RRule::Rule.new('FREQ=DAILY;COUNT=3', dtstart: Time.new(2016, 7, 1))
rrule.all
=> [2016-07-01 00:00:00 -0700, 2016-07-02 00:00:00 -0700, 2016-07-03 00:00:00 -0700]
```

Unless your rrule should be evaluated in UTC time, you should also pass an explicit timezone in the `tzid` option to ensure that daylight saving time boundaries are respected, etc.:

```ruby
rrule = RRule::Rule.new('FREQ=DAILY;COUNT=3', dtstart: Time.new(2016, 7, 1), tzid: 'America/Los_Angeles')
```

### Exceptions (EXDATEs)

To define exception dates, pass the `exdate` option:

```ruby
rrule = RRule::Rule.new('FREQ=DAILY;COUNT=3', dtstart: Time.new(2016, 7, 1), exdate: [DateTime.parse('2016-07-02 00:00:00 -0700'])
rrule.all
=> [2016-07-01 00:00:00 -0700, 2016-07-03 00:00:00 -0700]
```

### ActiveModel validator

In every project using `ActiveModel` the `RruleValidator` will automatically be loaded and can be used like this

```ruby
class MyEvent
  include ActiveModel::Validations

  attr_reader :recurrence_rule

  def initialize(recurrence_rule)
    @recurrence_rule = recurrence_rule
  end

  validates :recurrence_rule, rrule: true
end
```

or in a Rails app

```ruby
class MyEvent < ApplicationRecord
  field :recurrence_rule, type: String

  validates :recurrence_rule, rrule: true
end
```
